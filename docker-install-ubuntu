  1 : create a Directory to keep all the necessary files
      mkdir directory name
      cd directory name
  
  2: Pull the Docker image
     docker pull nginx:latest
  
  3: Verify that the NGINX image was pulled successfully
     docker images

  4: Create the Dockerfile and Index.HTML using vi command
     Dockerfile (follow below command)
  
      FROM nginx:1.10.1-alpine
      COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
      EXPOSE 8080
      CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  
    index.html (create any sample html page)
  
  5: Build the image
     docker build -t <new_image_name> .    (make sure to add a dot at the end )

  6: verify the image
    docker images

  7: Build and deploy the container
     docker run -d --name <name-container> -p 8080:80 <new_image_name>
